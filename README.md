# DarkRP Old Advert
Adds /advert back along with keeping /ad for players with different binds.

## Required Actions
You must drop this folder into your addons.

You must ALSO delete the advert billboard. You are not supposed to edit core files, but...

Delete the following folder:
gamemodes\darkrp\entities\entities\darkrp_billboard

## I can't delete the folder?
A lot of hosts automatically download/update DarkRP using an
SVN, and some hosts don't allow you to remove SVN related
files, so if you are unable to delete the folder, drag it out to
the root where you see the folders such as bin, garrysmod,
hl2mp, and sourceengine, and perhaps css. If you still
can't delete the folder, hit your host up with a support ticket
and tell them to delete it, they'll do it for you. If they don't,
rip you.
