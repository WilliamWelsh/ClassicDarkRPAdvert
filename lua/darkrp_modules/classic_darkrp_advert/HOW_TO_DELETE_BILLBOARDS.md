##How to Delete Billboards
You are not supposed to edit core files, but...

WARNING: This does require you to delete the following folder:
gamemodes\darkrp\entities\entities\darkrp_billboard

If you're using a host and not your PC:

A lot of hosts automatically download/update DarkRP using an
SVN, and some hosts don't allow you to remove SVN related
files, so if you are unable to delete the folder, drag it out to
the root where you see the folders such as bin, garrysmod,
hl2mp, and sourceengine, and perhaps css. If you still
can't delete the folder, hit your host up with a support ticket
and tell them to delete it, they'll do it for you.
